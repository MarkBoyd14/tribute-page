      <h2 id="headline">Career</h2>
      <p>Patrick Roy is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender and the former head coach and vice-president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is currently the general manager and head coach of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He is regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders of all time. In 2017 Roy was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.</p>
  
      <p>Nicknamed "Saint Patrick," Roy split his playing career in the NHL between the Montreal Canadiens, with whom he played for 11 years, and the Avalanche, with whom he played for eight years. Roy won four Stanley Cups during his career, two with each franchise. Roy was born in Quebec City, but grew up in Cap-Rouge, Quebec. </p>
  
      <p>In 2004, Roy was selected as the greatest goaltender in NHL history by a panel of 41 writers, coupled with a simultaneous fan poll. On November 13, 2006, Roy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is the only goalie in NHL history to win the Conn Smythe Trophy (the award given to the most valuable player in the Stanley Cup playoffs) three times, the only one to do so in different decades, and the only one to do so for two teams. Roy's number 33 jersey is retired by both the Canadiens and Avalanche.</p>
  
      <p>Roy is widely credited with popularizing the butterfly style of goaltending, which has since become the dominant style of goaltending around the world. He has previously served as the general manager and head coach of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), positions to which he returned in May 2018. Before stepping down in the 2016 off-season, Roy had been the head coach of the Avalanche since the 2013â€“14 season, during which he won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's best coach.</p>
